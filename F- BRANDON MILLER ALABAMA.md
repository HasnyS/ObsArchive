#Breakdown

**Creation** :
	
Miller's creation ability is predicated on the gravity of his shooting. Alabama utilizes him mostly off DHOs and off ball screening actions where he has been absolutely deadly as a shotmaker[insert stat here] and most of Miller creation will be him leveraging his shot in order to get defenders to play him too close or too aggressive.

Brandon doesn't handle the ball a lot but he will occasionally bring the ball up in transition or run the occasional PnR. He's able to punish defenders who give him too much space with the ability to take one dribble into a pull up 3 (usually a pound dribble but occasionally a BTL).  Preferring to drive left, Miller has a small bag of fakes, hesis and looping crossovers and a currently developing stop and start game to create separation inside the arc. While he's not one to drive through traffic often retreating when faced with help or picking his dribble/turning his back, he tends to be able to recover by throwing the ball back to his big and opening up a jumper with a give and go. His lack of burst, vertical athleticism or inside the arc scoring counters (floaters, mid-range pull ups or advanced footwork finishes) limit his ability here as its unlikely teams will need to send extra help to contain him inside the arc.  The lower release point on his jump-shot may also limit his ability to shoot over similarly sized defenders in the NBA further limiting him as a high volume creator. But he should be more than capable of getting to the rim and finishing playing in more of a tertiary NBA role where he will face tilted defenses and less help on a more spaced out court. 

Miller is a also decent passer for a wing he keeps his head up when he has the ball and and is able to find the open man and has occasionally flashed higher level flashes too such as finding rim runners for lobs or throwing darts through a small window to find a dunk. But he will also often telegraph reads, throw inaccurate passes resulting in turnovers or miss windows and take difficult shots instead. He should be able to grease a system but at this point not capable of being the main passing hub of at team. 


**Off Ball**

Off Ball 3 point scoring is where Miller shines most . He has been arguably the best shooter in his draft class shooting excellent across a variety of ways. He's been an elite catch and shoot player[stat here], always ready for the pass with his feet set and hands up and a quick release that lets him shoot against strong closeouts. Miller has a ton of schematic value too, with picture perfect footwork as a movement shooter coming off screens or DHOs[stat here]. Also a heady cutter and easy target due to his size able to put pressure on defenses that either play him too tight or take their eyes off of him for too long. 

Miller is also a player that really competes on the glass and will often crash the glass after a shot looking for misses but his lack of strength and vertical pop limit him here to be about average for his size but it is where he can make up for the lack of rim opportunities he can get with his handle 

**Defense**
Alabama used Miller as the 3 man in a big front-court and a role that will be similar to his job in the NBA. Miller doesn't have the strength or bounce to check 5s or interior oriented 4s or the feet and fluidity to really guard down. He will likely spend the majority of his time defending his position adequately being able to slide his feet ok and use his length to contest shots. Miller lack of leg bends has him struggle to fight over screens at 6'9 and will likely be best off switching or hedging Pick and Roll options.

Miller keeps his head up off ball and is reasonably heady but doesn't have any outstanding instincts or movement skills to really make him stand out here, has a tendency to over-help sometimes resulting in his assignment getting open. Can get the occasional block but lacks the vertical pop to be a real help side rim deterrent. 

Competes on the glass but just like on offense lack of pop and strength limit his effectiveness here even though he will be able to tap it a bit. 

**Next Steps**
Miller can improve his process as a player by finding pathways to be a threat inside the arc, while he has shown in-season growth at this he still has a long way to go. Working on skills such as playing off jump-stops and pivots, sharpening his floater and having a one dribble pull up inside the arc could do a lot for his scoring gravity. Miller will also need to reduce the amount of turnovers in the NBA which he can accomplish by adding more fakes and deceptiveness to his passing. Adding strength to his frame would also greatly benefit him on both sides of the ball, allowing him to play through contact either while driving or going for boards.
